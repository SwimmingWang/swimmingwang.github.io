  # Haptic feedback is essential for human–machine interaction, as it bridges physical and digital experiences and enables immersive engagement with virtual environments. However, current haptic devices are frequently tethered, lack portability and flexibility. They also have limited ability to deliver fine-grained, multi-dimensional feedback. To address these challenges, we present a flexible, ultra-thin, and user-customized electro-haptic device fabricated with soft materials and printable liquid metal ink. Its highly integrated and lightweight design minimizes interference with natural hand movements while maintaining reliable skin contact. By delivering finely controlled electrical stimulation through 15 electrodes, it can evoke a wide range of tactile sensations that cover diverse interaction scenarios. Our user study demonstrates that the device is comfortable to wear and capable of generating tunable, precise electro-haptic feedback, thereby significantly enhancing immersion and realism in human-machine interactions.
